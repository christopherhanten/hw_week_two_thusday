hw_week_two_thusday

for the next little while I'm going to have to handle my homework situation a little differently.

I am pretty much lost. I can understand what is going on; I just cant make it happen. I need to go back to the front of the course, luckily it is not to far in, and review.

I'll keep up in the front too. I wasn't quite ready for the onslaught last week. Now that I am a bit more used to it, I think I'll click shortly upon review.

Tonight I am working with the jsbin from this morning's jquery lesson. I am also reviewing vanilla javascript.
Depending on what time that concludes, I'll jive the homework for this evening a shot.
